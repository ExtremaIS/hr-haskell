## Overview

`hr` is a utility for displaying a horizontal rule in a terminal.

It is useful for marking a position in your terminal so that you can easily
find it again.  For example, use `hr` to display a horizontal rule before each
build of a project so that you can easily find the beginning of the output of
the last build.

## CLI

### Requirements

`hr` has only been tested on Linux.  It *might* work on Windows and macOS.

### Installation

#### `.deb` Package Installation

Check the [Releases][] page for `.deb` packages.

[Releases]: <https://github.com/ExtremaIS/hr-haskell/releases>

#### `.rpm` Package Installation

Check the [Releases][] page for `.rpm` packages.

#### Installation From Hackage

Install `hr` from [Hackage][] using [Cabal][] as follows:

```
$ cabal v2-install horizontal-rule
```

[Hackage]: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/horizontal-rule>
[Cabal]: <https://www.haskell.org/cabal/>

#### Installation From Stackage

Install `hr` from [Stackage][] using [Stack][] as follows:

```
$ stack install horizontal-rule
```

[Stackage]: <https://www.stackage.org/package/horizontal-rule>
[Stack]: <https://haskellstack.org/>

### Usage

See the [`hr` man page][] for usage information.

[`hr` man page]: <doc/hr.1.md>

#### Examples

The rule fills with width of the terminal by default:

```
$ hr
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

In cases when the terminal width cannot be determined, a default width is
used.  This default width can be set with an option:

```
$ hr -d 78
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

If desired, the rule width can be specified:

```
$ hr -w 60
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

In cases where the terminal cannot display Unicode, ASCII may be used:

```
$ hr -a
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The rule can include the current time:

```
$ hr -t
━━┫2021-05-27 19:26:09┣━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

The time format can be specified:

```
$ hr -t -f "%H:%M:%S.%q"
━━┫19:30:44.861779179000┣━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

The first line read from `STDIN` can be used as a note:

```
$ uname -m | hr -i
━━┫x86_64┣━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

When input is read, a timeout is used to ensure that `hr` does not "hang" when
there is no input.  The timeout (in milliseconds) can be specified:

```
$ uname -m | hr -i --timeout 100
━━┫x86_64┣━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

A note can be specified as one or more arguments:

```
$ hr unit tests
━━┫unit tests┣━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Different types of notes can be combined:

```
$ uname -m | hr -it unit tests
━━┫2021-05-27 19:48:48┣━┫unit tests┣━┫x86_64┣━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Library

You can easily include horizontal rules in the output of your own Haskell
software by using the library.  The Haskell package is named `horizontal-rule`
in [Hackage][] and [Stackage][] because there is an existing package named
[`hR`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hR).
