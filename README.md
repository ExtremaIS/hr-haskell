## Overview

`hr` is a utility for displaying a horizontal rule in a terminal.

It is useful for marking a position in your terminal so that you can easily
find it again.  For example, use `hr` to display a horizontal rule before each
build of a project so that you can easily find the beginning of the output of
the last build.

## Requirements

`hr` has only been tested on Linux.  It *might* work on Windows and macOS.

## Installation
