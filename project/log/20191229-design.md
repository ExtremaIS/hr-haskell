## History

A much celebrated benefit of using a programming language with strong, static
types is that the type system serves as a reliable guide when refactoring.
After making some initial changes, one can then repeatedly attempt to build
the project and resolve any resulting type errors.  There can be a lot of
output, however, and it can be difficult to locate the beginning of the output
of the latest build in the terminal history.

I use `hr` to make it easy to mark the beginning of builds.
